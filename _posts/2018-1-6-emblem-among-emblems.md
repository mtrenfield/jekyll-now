title: An emblem among emblems
---
From *Invisible Cities*, by Italo Calvino:

*As the seasons passed and his missions continued, Marco mastered the Tartar language and the national idioms and tribal dialects.  Now his accounts were the most precise and detailed that the Great Khan could wish and there was no question or curiosity which they did not satisfy.  And yet each piece of information about a place recalled to the emperor's mind that first gesture or object with which Marco had designated the place.  The new fact received a meaning from that emblem and also added to the emblem a new meaning.  Perhaps, Kublai thought, the empire is nothing but a zodiac of the mind's phantasms.*

*"On the day when I know all the emblems," he asked Marco, "shall I be able to possess my empire at last?"*

*And the Venetian answered: "Sire, do not believe it.  On that day you will be an emblem among emblems.*
